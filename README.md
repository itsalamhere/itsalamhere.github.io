## 🧑‍💻Data Science Portfolio by Mohamad Alamsyah

Hello, I'm Alam, a biomedical engineering fresh graduate from Indonesia 🇮🇩 Currently I'm learning data science via an online course with several projects across the journey. This website consists of a compilation of notebooks on data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Will try applying it into upcoming personal projects, preferably healthcare-adjacent ones I'm interested in.
