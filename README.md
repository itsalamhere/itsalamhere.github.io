# 🧑‍💻Data Science Portfolio by Mohamad Alamsyah

Hello, I'm Alam, a biomedical engineering fresh graduate from Indonesia 🇮🇩 Currently I'm learning data science via an online course with several projects across the journey. This website consists of a compilation of notebooks on data analysis and machine learning algorithms. Will try applying it into upcoming personal projects, preferably healthcare-adjacent ones I'm interested in.

## Machine Learning

### Predicting Heart Disease 🔮🫀
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/itsalamhere/itsalamhere.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/predicting_heart_disease.ipynb))

This project predicts a patient of getting a heart disease from several features by using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) or [`KNeighborsClassifier()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html). The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) includes relevant information for each patient, such as their personal information and some medical data.

### Classifying Heart Disease 📂🫀
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/itsalamhere/itsalamhere.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/classifying_heart_disease.ipynb))

This project classifies a patient of heart disease through several features by using [`LogisticRegression()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html). The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes several medical characteristics on each patient, including resting blood pressure, fasting blood sugar, up to ST depression induced by exercise and number of major vessels colored by spectroscopy.

### Predicting Employee Productivity 🧑‍🏭💹
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/itsalamhere/itsalamhere.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/predicting_employee_productivity.ipynb))

This project predicts productivity of garment factory employees using a model of [`DecisionTreeClassifier()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html) and [`RandomForestClassifier()`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) to get the strongest predictors. The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Productivity+Prediction+of+Garment+Employees) is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository which includes several aspects from day, team number, up to standard minute value for a task and incentive.
